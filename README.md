### 1. What is JavaScript
* JavaScript is a scripting language used to create dynamic and interactive websites. It is supported by all major web browsers.
* JavaScript is basically a client-side scripting language but it can also be used on the server-side with the help of technologies such as Node.js.

**[:top: Scroll to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)**

### 2. What are the different data types in JavaScript
| Primitive   |Non-primitive |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Boolean, NULL, undefined, BigInt, String, Number, Symbol  | Object, Array | 


**[:top: Scroll to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)**

### 3. What are the different ways to create an Object in JavaScript

##### a) Object Literals: A comma-separated set of name and value pairs that is wrapped inside curly braces.

```javascript
var person = {
    name: 'Surbhi',
    age: 25,
    occupation: 'Software Engineer'
}
```
##### b) Object.create method: It Creates a new object, by using an existing object as the prototype of the newly created object.

```javascript
const person = {
    name: 'Surbhi',
    age: 25,
    occupation: 'Software Engineer'
}

var info = Object.create(person);
console.log(info.name); // output - Surbhi
```

##### c) Object constructor: Constructor function allows to create objects with the help of new keyword

```javascript
const person = new Person();
```

##### d) using ES6: We can create object using ES6 class feature

```javascript
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}
  
let person = new Person('Surbhi');
console.log(person.name);  //output - Surbhi
```

### 4. Difference between “==” and “===” operators
* == : While comparing two operands, checks for only value
```js
console.log(1=="1");  // output=>>>>>>>>> true
```
* === : While comparing two operands, checks for value as well as data type
```js
console.log(1==="1");  // output=>>>>>>>>> false
```

**[:top: Scroll to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)**

### 5. Is javascript single-threaded or multi-threaded
* JavaScript is Single-threaded

**[:top: Scroll to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)**

### 6. What are arrow functions and its features
Arrow functions were introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) and provide a simpler and compact way to write functions. They are also called “fat arrow functions”
###### Syntax
```javascript
const functionName = (something) => {
  return something;
}
```
###### Features of arrow functions
1. They use a concise syntax which makes them shorter and easier to read as compared to traditional function expressions
2. They do not bind their own this value, but instead inherit the this value from the enclosing lexical scope
3. They do not have "prototype" property and hence cannot be used as a constructor
4. If the arrow function body consists of a single expression, that expression will be implicitly returned, without the need for a return statement.
5. If an arrow function has only one parameter, the parentheses around the parameter list can be omitted.

### 7. What do you mean by Synthetic events
Synthetic events are objects that act as a cross-browser wrapper around a browser's native event. It has the same interface as the browser's native event, including stopPropagation() and preventDefault(), except the events work identically across all browsers.

**[:top: Scroll to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)**

### 8. What is array destructuring
Array destructuring is a unique feature in JavaScript that allows you to extract array's value into new variables. For e.g.,
```javascript
const arr = [1,2,3];
const [num1, num2, num3] = arr;
console.log(num1); // output =====> 1
console.log(num2); // output =====> 2
```
**[:top: Scroll to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)**

### 9. Can we combine two arrays using any es6 operators
* Yes, using Spread Operators
```javascript
const arr1 = [1,2,3,4];
const arr2 = [5,6];
const arr3 = [...arr1, ...arr2]
console.log(arr3) // output =====> [1,2,3,4,5,6]
```

**[:top: Scroll to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)**

### 10. Why javascript is dynamically typed language
JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, because the type of a variable is determined at runtime based on the value it holds. For e.g.,
```javascript
var variable_one = "surbhi"  // "string" datatype is determined at runtime
var variable_two = 20        // "number" datatype is determined at runtime
```
**[:top: Scroll to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)**

### 11. Difference between Undeclared and Undefined
**Undeclared -** A variable that has not been declared or doesn't exists in the code
```javascript
console.log(a); // output =====> ReferenceError: a is not defined
```
**Undefined -** A variable that has been declared but not assigned a value yet
```javascript
let a;
console.log(a); // output =====> undefined
```
**[:top: Scroll to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)**

### 12. Difference between Null and Undefined
**Null -** Null means an empty value or a blank value. It is used to represent an intentional absence of value. 
```javascript
let demo = null;
console.log(demo); // output =====> null
```

**Undefined -** Undefined means the variable has been declared, but its value has not been assigned yet.
```javascript
let demo;
console.log(demo); // output =====> undefined
```

### 13. What is Temporal Dead Zone
A "let" or "const" variable is said to be in a "temporal dead zone" (TDZ) from the start of the block until code execution reaches the line where the variable is declared and initialized.

In JavaScript, variables declared with let or const are not hoisted to the top of the block scope. If you try to access a variable before it is declared, a ReferenceError will be thrown.
```javascript
{
  // TDZ for name variable starts here
  console.log(name); // ReferenceError
  let name = "surbhi"; // End of TDZ for name
}
```
**[:top: Scroll to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)**

### 14. What is IIFE
IIFE stands for Immediately Invoked Function Expression. It is a JavaScript function that is executed as soon as it is defined. 

An IIFE is typically written as an anonymous function expression that is enclosed within a set of parentheses, followed by another set of parentheses that call the function. For e.g.,
```javascript
(function() {
  // code goes here
})();
```
**[:top: Scroll to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)**

### 15. What is Hoisting
Hoisting is a default behavior in JavaScript where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of the current scope

**Variable hoisting**
```javascript
console.log(a);  // output =====> undefined
var a = 10;
```

```javascript
a=10;
console.log(a);  // output =====> 10
var a;
```

**Function hoisting**
```javascript
demo();  // demo console
function demo() {
	console.log('demo console'); 
}
```

```diff
**Note**
+ Only function declarations are hoisted, not the function expressions.
+ Only the declaration is hoisted, not the initialization. 
```

### 16. What are Cookies
In javascript, a cookie is a piece of data, stored in small text files, on the user's computer by the browser.
Cookies are set, read and deleted using the document.cookie property

```javascript
//**Set a cookie**
document.cookie = "username=surbhi";

//**Read a cookie**
let cookie_variable = document.cookie; 

//**Delete a cookie** (set the expiration date to a past date/time)
document.cookie = "username=; expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 UTC; path=/;";
```
**[:top: Scroll to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)**

### 17. What is memoization
Memoization is a technique used in JavaScript to optimize the performance of functions by caching the results of expensive function calls, based on their input parameters.
For e.g., If a function is called multiple times with the same input parameters, then it will perform the same calculations each time. By memoizing the function, we can use the cached result.

```js
function memoizedAdd(num1, num2) {
  let cache = {};
  return function (a, b) {
    const key = num1 + ' and ' + num2;
    if (key in cache) {
      console.log('Retrieving from cache:', key);
      return cache[key];
    } else {
      console.log('Calculating result:', key);
      const result = num1 + num2;
      cache[key] = result;
      return result;
    }
  };
}

const add = memoizedAdd();
console.log(add(2, 3)); // "Calculating result:", "2 and 3", output ========> 5
console.log(add(2, 3)); // "Retrieving from cache:", "2 and 3" output ========> 5
```

### 18. Difference between var, let and const
In javascript, there are 3 ways to declare a variable - var, let, and const. However, they have some differences in their behavior and scope.
| var | let | const |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Function scoped | Block scoped | Block scoped | 
| Can be re-declared in the same scope | Can not be re-declared in the same scope | Can not be re-declared in the same scope |
| Can be updated in the same scope | Can be updated in the same scope | Can not be updated in the same scope |
| Hoisted to the top of their scope | Hoisted to the top but are not initialized | Hoisted to the top but are not initialized |
| Can be declared without being initialized |Can be declared without being initialized | Can not be declared without being initialized |

### 19. What is a callback function
A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function. The function that receives the callback as an argument can then invoke the callback at any time during its execution. 
```js
function message(callback) {
    console.log('Hi, i am message function');
    callback();
}
// callback function
function callBackFun() {
    console.log('Hey, I am a callback function');
}
// passing callback function as an argument to message function
message(callBackFun);
```

### 20. Is it possible to have both local and global variables with the same name
Yes, we can have both with the same name. But when we do this, the local variable will take precedence over the global variable within the scope of the function or block of code in which it is declared.

However, outside of that scope, the global variable will still be accessible using its name.

```js
let a = 10;
function Demo(){
let a = 20;
console.log(a, "local scope");
}
Demo();
console.log(a, "global scope");
```

### 21. Difference between Local Storage and Session Storage
Local storage and session storage are web storage provided by web browsers to store data on the client-side

**Local Storage** - Data stored in local storage will persist even after the browser window is closed or the user navigates away from the website and it is available across all windows and tabs of the same origin.

**Session Storage** - Data stored in session storage will be deleted when the browser window is closed or the session ends and it is available only within the same window or tab that created the data.

**[:top: Scroll to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)**

### 22. Difference between forEach() and map()
map() and forEach() are array methods that can be used to iterate over an array.
**map()** 
1. map() method receives a function as an argument, executes it once for each array element and returns a new array
2. It is generally used when we need to modify/change data, because it returns a new array with the transformed data
3. It is chainable because we can attach sort(), filter() etc. after performing a map() method on an array

```js
const arr = [1,2,3,4,5]
let result = arr.map(x => x * x)
console.log(result)   // output ========> [1,4,9,16,25]
```

**forEach()** 
1. forEach() method receives a function as an argument, executes it once for each array element but returns undefined.
2. It is generally used when we just need to iterate over an array 
3. It is not chainable

```js
const arr = [1,2,3,4,5]
let result = arr.forEach(x => x * x)
console.log(result)   // output ========> undefined
```
**[:top: Scroll to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)**

### 23. What is rest operator
1. The rest operator was introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) and it is represented by three dots (...)
2. It is used in function parameters and allows you to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array

```js
function addition(...numbers) {
  return numbers.reduce((a,b)=>a+b);
}
console.log(addition(1, 2, 3, 4)); // output ========> 10
```

3. It collects all the remaining arguments passed to a function into an array

```js
function profile(name, designation,...location) {
  return location
}
console.log(profile("surbhi","SE","India","Indore","M.P")); // output ========> ["India", "Indore", "M.P"]
```
**[:top: Scroll to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)**

### 24. What is spread operator
1. The spread operator was introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) and it is represented by three dots (...)
2. It allows an iterable to be spread into individual elements
```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4,5];
console.log(...arr); // output ======> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
```
3. It can be used to copy the elements of an existing array into a new array, or to concatenate arrays
```js
const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
const arr2 = [4, 5, 6];
const arr3 = [...arr1, ...arr2];
console.log(arr3);  // output =======> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```
4. It can be used to copy the properties of an existing object into a new object
```js
const obj1 = { a:1, b:2 };
const obj2 = { c:3 };
const obj3 = { ...obj1, ...obj2 }; 
console.log(obj3); // output ========> { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }
```

### 25. Difference between async and defer
async and defer are the attributes used with the script tag in HTML to load javaScript files.

**Async** - The script is loaded in parallel to the HTML parsing, and executed as soon as it is available i.e., it executes the script immediately after it is loaded. It can be useful for scripts that don't depend on the DOM. 

**Defer** - The script is loaded in parallel to the HTML parsing, and executed after the page is completely loaded i.e., it waits until the page has finished parsing. It can be useful for scripts that depend on the DOM.

### 26. What is Nullish coalescing operator
1. The nullish coalescing (??) operator is a logical operator
2. It allows you to check if a value is either null or undefined
3. It returns its right-hand side operand if its left-hand side operand is null or undefined, otherwise returns its left-hand side operand
```js
console.log((null || undefined) ?? "foo"); // output ========>  "foo"
console.log("hello" ?? "foo");		   // output ========>  "hello" 
```

### 27. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument
**Parameter** - A parameter is a variable that is defined during a function declaration or definition. It represents a value that the function or method expects to receive as an input.

**Argument** - An argument is the actual value that is passed to a function or method when it is called. 
```js
function Demo(parameter1, parameter2){
 something------
 something------
}
Demo(argument1, argument2);
```
**[:top: Scroll to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)**

### 28. What is a closure
A closure is a combination of a function and the environment in which it was created(lexical scope). It gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function even if the outer function has returned
```js
function Demo() {
  let name = "Surbhi";
  function displayName() {
    console.log(name);
  }
  return displayName;
}

const result = Demo();
result();
```
**[:top: Scroll to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)**

### 29. Difference between function declaration and function expression
**Function Declaration**
1. A function declaration defines a function using the function keyword, followed by the function name
2. We can call a function, declared using a function declaration, before it is defined. Because it is hoisted to the top of its scope
3. It does not require a variable assignment 
```js
function Message() {
  console.log("Welcome Message"); // output ========> Welcome Message
}
Message();
```

**Function Expression**
1. A function Expression is similar to a function declaration without the function name
2. We can not call a function, declared using a function expression, before it is defined
3. It can be stored in a variable assignment
```js
const Message = function() {
  console.log("Welcome Message"); // output ========> Welcome Message
}
Message();
```

### 30. What are the different ways to create an array in javascript
1. **Using the array literal notation**
```js
const arr = [1,2,3,4,5];
```
2. **Using the Array() constructor**
```js
const arr = new Array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
```
**[:top: Scroll to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)**

### 31. Difference between window and document in javascript
**window object** - window is the topmost object. It represents the browser window or tab containing a DOM document. It provides various properties and methods to manipulate the browser window, such as window.alert(), window.confirm(), and window.location. 

**document object** - document represents the HTML document that is being displayed in the window. It provides properties and methods to manipulate the HTML elements in the document, such as document.title, document.getElementById(), and document.createElement().

**[:top: Scroll to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)**

### 32. What is strict mode in JavaScript
1. Strict mode was introduced in ECMAScript 5
2. It performs additional checks on your code to prevent certain types of bugs and errors that may go unnoticed e.g., using undeclared variables, using duplicate property names in objects
3. It can be enabled at either the global level or at the function level
4. It can't be apply to block statements enclosed in {} braces
5. To invoke strict mode, put the exact statement “use strict”; or ‘use strict’; 

**[:top: Scroll to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)**

### 33. What are the different ways to empty an array in javaScript
**Using length property**
```js
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
arr.length = 0;
console.log(arr); // output ========> []
```

**Assigning it to a new empty array**
```js
let arr = [1,2,3,4,5];
arr = [];
console.log(arr); // output ========> []
```

**Using the splice() method**
```js
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
arr.splice(0, arr.length);
console.log(arr); // output ========> []
```

### 34. What is NaN in javascript
1. In Javascript, NaN stands for "Not a Number"
2. It is a global property that represents an unrepresentable mathematical result
3. It is returned when a mathematical operation has no meaningful result. E.g., dividing zero by zero, multiplying/dividing a non-numeric value by a number etc.

```js
console.log(0/0);                  // output ========> NaN
console.log("a"*1);                // output ========> NaN
console.log("a"/1)		   // output ========> NaN
console.log(Math.sqrt(-1));	   // output ========> NaN
console.log(parseInt("blabla"));   // output ========> NaN
```

### 35. Javascript naming convention
1. Use camelCase (lowercase for the first word, then uppercase for subsequent words) for variable and function names
2. Use PascalCase for class names (uppercase for the first letter of each word)
3. Use "is" or "has" as prefixes for boolean variables
4. Use UPPERCASE for constants 
5. Use descriptive and meaningful names for your variables, functions, and classes.

```js
//variable
let firstName = "Surbhi";

//function
function displayName() {
 return "Surbhi Dighe";
}
displayName();

//boolean
let isLoading = false;
let hasName = true;

//constants
let SECONDS = 60;

//class
class DisplayName { 
  constructor(firstName, lastName) { 
    this.firstName = firstName; 
    this.lastName = lastName; 
  }
}
var name = new DisplayName('Surbhi', 'Dighe');
```

### 36. Difference between call(), apply() and bind()
call(), apply(), and bind() methods are used to attach a function into an object and call the function as if it belonged to that object. 

**call()**  - call() is used to invoke a function immediately with a specified *this* value and allows you to pass the arguments one by one
```js
let person = {name: 'Surbhi'};
function printName(message) {
    console.log(message + ' ' + this.name);   // output ========> "Hello Surbhi"
}
printName.call(person, 'Hello'); 
```
**apply()** - apply() is used to invoke a function immediately with a specified *this* value and allows you to pass the arguments as an array
```js
let person = {name: 'Surbhi'};
function printName(message) {
    console.log(message + ' ' + this.name);   // output ========> "Hello Surbhi"
}
printName.apply(person, ['Hello']); 
```
**bind()** - bind() returns a new function (which can be invoked anytime), with a specified *this* value and allows you to pass in arguments
```js
let person = {name: 'Surbhi'};
function printName(message) {
    console.log(message + ' ' + this.name);   // output ========> "Hello Surbhi"
}
let sayHello = printName.bind(person, "Hello"); 
sayHello();
```

### 37. What is the use of isNaN function
isNaN() is a built-in JavaScript function. It takes a single argument and returns true if the argument is not a number, otherwise it returns false.
```js
let num1 = 5;
let num2 = "hi";

console.log(isNaN(num1));	// output ========> false
console.log(isNaN(num2));	// output ========> true
```

### 38. What is 'this' keyword in javascript
The value of 'this' is determined by the context in which it is used. In general, 'this' keyword refers to the object it belongs to.
The 'this' keyword in JavaScript can have different values depending on where it is used -
1. If it is used inside a method, then it refers to the object that it belongs to
2. If it is used inside any function or alone (i.e outside any function or method), then it referes to the global object
3. If it is used in the context of an event handler, such as a click event, then it refers to the element that triggered the event

### 39. How do we add comments in javascript
**Single-line comments** - Add comments using 2 forward slashes // 
```js
// this is a single line comment
```
**Multi-line comments** - Enclose the text between /* and */
```js
/*
This is a
multiline comment
example
*/
```

### 40. What is the use of typeof operator
The typeof operator returns a string that indicates the data type of the variable/value.
```js
let var1 = "Surbhi";
let var2 = 10;
console.log(typeof var1);	// output ========> "string"
console.log(typeof var2);       // output ========> "number"
```

### 41. Is JavaScript case-sensitive
Yes, JavaScript is a case-sensitive language. For e.g., the variables firstName and firstname are considered to be two different variables.
```js
let firstName = "Surbhi";
console.log(firstname);         // output ========> Uncaught ReferenceError: firstname is not defined
```

### 42. Difference between push() and unshift()
Both are used to add elements to an array, but they add elements in different ways.

**push()** - It adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array.
```js
let arr = [1,2,3,4];
let newArr = arr.push(5,6,7);
console.log(newArr); 		// output ========> 7
console.log(arr);		// output ========> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
```
**unshift()** - It adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns the new length of the array.
```js
let arr = [1,2,3,4];
let newArr = arr.unshift(5,6,7);
console.log(newArr);		// output ========> 7
console.log(arr);		// output ========> [5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```
**[:top: Scroll to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)**

### 43. Difference between pop() and shift()
Both are used to remove elements from an array, but they remove elements in different ways.

**pop()** - It removes the last element of an array and returns the removed element.
```js
let arr = [1,2,3,4];
let newArr = arr.pop();
console.log(newArr);		// output ========> 4
console.log(arr);		// output ========> [1,2,3]
```

**shift()** - It removes the first element of an array and returns the removed element.
```js
let arr = [1,2,3,4];
let newArr = arr.shift();
console.log(newArr);		// output ========> 1
console.log(arr);		// output ========> [2,3,4]
```

### 44. Different ways to access DOM elements in js
*getElementById* - This method is used to get an element by its ID.

*getElementsByClassName* - This method is used to get a collection of elements by their class name.

*getElementsByTagName* - This method is used to get a collection of elements by their tag name.

*querySelector* - This method is used to get the first element that matches a specified CSS selector.

*querySelectorAll* - This method is used to get a collection of elements that match a specified CSS selector.

**[:top: Scroll to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)**

### 45. What are promises
In JavaScript, promises are used to handle asynchronous operations. The code does not directly or immediately return a value. Instead, it returns a promise that, it will eventually get resolved or rejected. 
A promise can have three possible states:

*Pending* - The initial state, before the promise is resolved or rejected.

*Resolved* - When a promise has been successfully completed and a value is returned.

*Rejected* - When a promise has been failed and an error is returned.

```js
let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  const result = AsynchronousTaskFunction();
  if (result) {
    resolve(result);
  } else {
    reject(new Error('Operation failed'));
  }
});

promise.then(result => {
  console.log(result, "It is resolved");
}).catch(error => {
  console.error(error, "It is rejected");
});
```

### 46. What is a prototype
Every object in JavaScript has a built-in property, which is called its prototype. All JavaScript objects inherit properties and methods from a prototype.

It allows us to add properties and methods to all instances of a given object type.
```js

function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}
Person.prototype.city = "Indore"
var person1 = new Person('John', 30);
console.log(person1);			
```

### 47. What is a callback hell
Callback hell is a situation in which callback functions are nested inside each other at several levels, making the code difficult to read, write, and maintain.
```js
asyncFunc1(function(response1) {
  asyncFunc2(response1, function(response2) {
    asyncFunc3(response2, function(response3) {
      asyncFunc4(response3, function(response4) {
       asyncFunc5(response4, function(response5) {
        // ... and so on
        });
      });
    });
  });
});
```
**[:top: Scroll to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)**

### 48. What is an event loop
The event loop is a key mechanism in JavaScript that provides an illusion of being multithreaded despite being single-threaded, allowing for non-blocking, asynchronous processing of events and callbacks.It monitors both the callback queue and the call stack. 

If the call stack is not empty, the event loop waits until it is empty 

If the call stack is empty it places the next function from the callback queue to the call stack

### 49. ES6 and its features
ES6 stands for ECMAScript 6, also known as ECMAScript 2015. It is the sixth major version of the ECMAScript language specification for JavaScript. Below are some of the significant features of ES6

*Arrow functions, template literals, block-scoped variables (let and const), default function parameters, array and object destructing, promises, rest and spread operators, classes.*

### 50. Difference between function and method
**method** - A method is a function associated with an object. 
```js
let obj = {
name:"Surbhi",
greet: function(){     
return `Hi ${this.name}`
}
}
console.log(obj.greet());
```
**function** - A function is a self-contained block of code that can be defined and called independently of any object.
```js
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
sum(2,4);
```
**[:top: Scroll to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)**

### 51. What is aync and await
async/await is a feature in JavaScript that allows us to write asynchronous code that looks more like synchronous code. "await" works only inside "async" functions

"async" ensures that a function returns a promise and "await" pause the execution of the function until a promise is resolved or rejected. 
```js
const getData = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=New%20York&appid=YOUR_API_KEY');
  const data = await response.json();
  console.log(data);
}
getData();
```
**[:top: Scroll to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)**

### 52. What is the role of event.preventDefault()
The preventDefault() method is used to stop the default action of an element.

E.g., when a user submits a form, the browser sends the form data to the URL specified in the action attribute. In some cases, we may want to prevent this default behavior.

**[:top: Scroll to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)**

### 53. What is the use of JSON.stringify()
JSON.stringify() method is used to convert a JavaScript object or value into an equivalent JSON string. 
```js
const obj = { firstname: "Surbhi", lastname: "Dighe" };
const jsonString = JSON.stringify(obj);
console.log(jsonString); // output ========> {"firstname":"Surbhi","lastname":"Dighe"}
```

### 54. How can you stop the setTimeout
You can use the clearTimeout method. This method takes the id returned by setTimeout and cancels the timer.
```js
const timerId = setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('setTimeout is done');
}, 5000);
clearTimeout(timerId);
```

### 55. If Javascript is single threaded, how it supports asynchronous operations
JavaScript is single-threaded, means it can execute only one task at a time. Still, it supports asynchronous operations using the Web API provided by the browser.

**[:top: Scroll to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)**

### 56. What is javascript scope
In JavaScript, scope refers to the current context of your code. This context determines visibility and accessibility of variables, functions, and objects within a certain part of the code.
Generally, there are two types of scope in JavaScript - global scope and local scope.

**[:top: Scroll to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)**

### 57. Difference between global scope and local scope
**Global scope** - Global scope refers to the variables, functions, and objects that are defined outside of any function or block. They can be accessible from any part of the code.
```js
let name = "Surbhi";
function printName() {
  console.log(name);  		// output ========> Surbhi
}
printName();
```

**Local scope** - Local scope refers to the variables, functions, and objects that are defined inside any function or block. They can be accessible only within the function or block where they are defined.
```js
function printName() {
  let name = "Surbhi;
  console.log(name); 		// output ========> Surbhi
}
printName();
console.log(name); 		// ReferenceError: name is not defined
```
**[:top: Scroll to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)**

### 58. What are the different ways to convert a string to an integer

**1. parseInt()** - This function takes a string and an optional radix (a number between 2 and 36 that represents the base in a numeral system) as its arguments.
```js
console.log(parseInt("20"));		// output ========> 20
console.log(parseInt("52", 8));		// output ========> 42
```
**2. unary plus operator (+)** - This operator converts a string into a number and it should be placed before the operand.
```js
console.log(+"10");			// output ========> 10
```
**3. Number()** - It is a built-in function which converts its argument to a number. If the argument is a string that contains non-numeric characters, then it returns NaN.
```js
Number("10");				// output ========> 10
Number("abc");    			// output ========> NaN
```

### 60. Name some JavaScript frameworks and libraries
**Frameworks** - Angular, Ember.js, Vue.js, Meteor, Next.js

**Libraries** - React, Backbone.js

**[:top: Scroll to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)**

### 61. What is event bubbling and event capturing
Event bubbling and Event Capturing are two different mechanisms used for handling event propagation in the HTML DOM API. When an event is triggered on an element which is inside another element, and both elements have an event listener attached to them , the event propagation mode determines the order in which the elements receive the event.

**Event Bubbling** - The event is first triggered on the innermost element and then propagated/bubbles up to its parent elements and eventually to the outermost element in the DOM hierarchy.

**Event Capturing** - The event is first triggered on the outermost element and then propagated/bubbles down to its child elements and eventually to the innermost element in the DOM hierarchy.

**[:top: Scroll to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)**

### 62. What is the role of event.stopPropagation()
This method is used to stop the event from propagating up or down the DOM hierarchy.

**[:top: Scroll to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)**

### 63. How can we change the style of an element using javascript
To change the style of an element using JavaScript, we can use the style property of the element's DOM object.
```js
document.getElementById("myDiv").style.backgroundColor = "red";
```
**[:top: Scroll to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)**

### 64. What is object destructuring
Object destructuring allows you to extract properties from an object and assign them to variables.
```js
const fullname = {
  firstName: 'Surbhi',
  lastName: 'Dighe',
};
const { firstName, lastName } = fullname;
console.log(firstName); 		// output ========> 'Surbhi'
console.log(lastName); 			// output ========> 'Dighe'
```

### 65. Difference between an Alert Box and a Confirmation Box
**Alert Box** - It has only one button, typically labeled "OK" and it is used to display a message to the user.

**Confirmation Box** - It has two buttons, typically labeled "OK" and "Cancel" and it is used to ask the user to confirm an action. 

**[:top: Scroll to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)**

### 66. How can we handle exceptions with javascript
In JavaScript, we can handle exceptions using a try-catch block. The try block contains the code that might throw an exception, and the catch block contains the code that handles the exception if it occurs.
```js
try {
  const name = "Surbhi";
  console.log(firstname)
} catch (error) {
  console.log("Error: " + error);  // output ========> Error: ReferenceError: firstname is not defined
}
```

### 67. What are the advantages of using External JavaScript
- Improve the load time of web pages
- Ease of editing
- Code reusability
- Separation of Code

**[:top: Scroll to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)**

### 68. What is an anonymous function
An anonymous function is a function that does not have a name. It is common to assign anonymous functions to a variable or use them as callback functions.
```js
const sayHi = function() {
  console.log("Hi there!!");
};
sayHi();
```
**[:top: Scroll to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)**

### 69. What is a first order function
A first order function is a function that does not take any other functions as arguments and does not return any function as its result.
```js
function sayHello() {
  console.log("A first order function")
}
sayHello();
```

### 70. Different ways to access object properties in javascript
**Dot notation** -  It uses dot (.) to access the object properties.
```js
object.propertyName
```
**Bracket notation** - It uses bracket "[ ]" to access the object properties.
```js
object[propertyName]
```
**Object destructuring** - It creates variables that correspond to the object properties.
```js
const obj1 = {name : "surbhi", designation : "SE"}
const {name , designation} = obj1;
console.log(name, designation)   	// output ========> "Surbhi","SE"
```

**[:top: Scroll to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)**

### 71. Difference between slice() and splice()
**slice()** - This method creates a new array by copying a specified section of an existing array and returns that new array. This operation does not modify the original array in any way.
```js
const arr=[1,2,3,4,5];
const result = arr.slice(2)
console.log(arr);		// output ========> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
console.log(result);		// output ========> [3, 4, 5]
```

**splice()** - This method is used to add or remove elements from an array. It modifies the original array and returns an array containing the removed elements (if any).
```js
const arr=[1,2,3,4,5];
const result = arr.splice(2)
console.log(arr); 		// output ========> [1, 2]
console.log(result);		// output ========> [3, 4, 5]
```

### 72. What are the escape characters in JavaScript
When working with special characters such as ampersands (&), apostrophes ('), double quotes (" "), and single quotes (' '). JavaScript requires the use of escape characters, which are often represented by the backslash (\). These escape characters instruct JavaScript to interpret the special characters correctly.
Below are some common escape characters in JavaScript:
- \n - Represents a newline character.
- \t - Represents a tab character.
- \' - Represents a single quote character.
- \" - Represents a double quote character.
- \\ - Represents a backslash character.
- \r - Represents a carriage return character.

### 73. Different ways to redirect a page in javascript
**location.href** - It is used to navigate to a new page and add it to the browser's history.
```js
window.location.href = "https://www.example.com";
```
**location.replace** - It is used to replace the current page with a new page without adding it to the history.
```js
window.location.replace("https://www.example.com");
```

### 74. What is the difference between innerHTML and innerText
innerHTML retrieves or modifies the HTML content of an element, including its tags, while innerText only retrieves or modifies the text content of an element, excluding any HTML tags.
```js
//HTML code
<div id="example">Hello <strong>world</strong>!</div>

//Javascript code
let result = document.getElementById("example").innerHTML;
console.log(result); 		// output ========> "Hello <strong>world</strong>!"
```
```js
//HTML code
<div id="example">Hello <strong>world</strong>!</div>

//Javascript code
let result = document.getElementById("example").innerText;
console.log(result); 		// output ========> "Hello world!"
```

### 75. How can you get current time using js
To get the current time using JavaScript, you can use the built-in Date object.
```js
let currentTime = new Date();
let hours = currentTime.getHours();
let minutes = currentTime.getMinutes();
let seconds = currentTime.getSeconds();
console.log(`Current time is ${hours}:${minutes}:${seconds}`); // output ========> "Current time is 16:7:22"
```

### 76. What is currying
Currying is the process of breaking down a function that takes multiple arguments into a series of functions that take a single argument.
```js
const add = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
}
const curryingAdd = (a) => (b) => a + b;
console.log(add(5, 4)); 			// output ========> 9
console.log(curryingAdd(5)(4));			// output ========> 9
```

### 77. Difference between shallow copy and deep copy
**shallow copy** - It creates a new object that points to the same memory location as the original object. Therefore, any changes made to the original object will also be reflected in the shallow copy. It can be done using the spread operator or object.assign() method.

**deep copy** - It creates a completely new object with its own memory space. This means that any changes made to the original object will not be reflected in the deep copy. It can be done using the JSON.parse() and JSON.stringify() methods.

**[:top: Scroll to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)**

### 78. What is a service worker
A service worker is a kind of web worker that operates in the background of a web page, decoupled from the primary browser thread, and capable of executing diverse tasks. It is essentially a JavaScript file that is associated with a web page and executes independently, without depending on the user interface.

**[:top: Scroll to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)**

### 79. What is JSON
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate.
```js
{
"users":[
    {"name":"Test1", "age":"20"},
    {"name":"Test2", "age":"30"},
    {"name":"Test3", "age":"40"}

## Output Based Questions

**1. What will be the output**
```js
let arr = [1,2,3,4,5,-6,7];
arr.length =0;
console.log(arr);
```
- Output :point_right: [ ] 
- Reason :point_right: The length of the array has been set to 0, so the array becomes empty

**[:top: Scroll to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)**

**2. What will be the output**
```js
x = 10;
console.log(x);
var x;
```
- Output :point_right: 10 
- Reason :point_right: The declaration of the variable x is hoisted to the top of its scope

**[:top: Scroll to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)**

**3. What will be the output**
```js
let a = {x:1,y:2}
let b = a;
b.x = 3;
console.log(a);
console.log(b);
```
- Output :point_right: { x: 3, y: 2 } { x: 3, y: 2 } 
- Reason :point_right: 'a' and 'b' both are pointing to the same reference

**[:top: Scroll to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)**

**4. What will be the output**
```js
for(var i = 0; i < 10; i++){
    setTimeout(function(){
      console.log("value is " + i);
  })
}
```
- Output :point_right: 10 times, "value is 10"
- Reason :point_right: "var" has a function scope, and there will be only one shared binding for the iterations. By the time the setTimeout function gets executed, the for loop has already completed and the value of the variable i is 10. 

**[:top: Scroll to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)**

**5. What will be the output**
```js
for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++){
    setTimeout(function(){
      console.log("value is " + i);
  })
}
```
- Output :point_right: 10 times "value is" followed by the value of i in each iteration, from 0 to 9
- Reason :point_right: "let" has a block scope, and a new binding will be created for each iteration. Here, a new variable i is created and has a different value for each iteration of the loop

**6. What will be the output**
```js
function hello() {
  console.log("1");
    setTimeout(()=>{
        console.log("2");
    })
  console.log("3");
}
hello();
```
- Output :point_right: "1" followed by "3", and then after a small delay, "2".
- Reason :point_right: console.log("1") statement logs "1" to the console. Then setTimeout() function is set to execute the callback function in the next event loop iteration and logs "3" to the console

**7. What will be the output**
```js
let f = "8";
let a = 1;
console.log((+f)+a+1);
```
- Output :point_right: 10
- Reason :point_right: The expression (+f) is a shorthand way to convert the string value of f to a number. Therefore, (+f) evaluates to 8

**8. What will be the output**
```js
let a = 10;
if(true){
   let a = 20;
   console.log(a, "inside");
}
console.log(a, "outside");
```
- Output :point_right: 20, "inside" and 10, "outside"
- Reason :point_right: The variable "a" declared inside "if" has block scope and does not affect the value of the outer "a" variable.

**9. What will be the output**
```js
var a = "xyz";
var a = "pqr";
console.log(a)
```
- Output :point_right: "pqr"
- Reason :point_right: Both the variables are declared using "var" keyword with the same name "a". The second variable declaration will override the first variable declaration

**10. What will be the output**
```js
const arr1= [1,2,3,4];
const arr2= [6,7,5];
const result = [...arr1, ...arr2];
console.log(result);
```
- Output :point_right: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 5]
- Reason :point_right: Spread operator (...) concatenates the two arrays into "result" array
